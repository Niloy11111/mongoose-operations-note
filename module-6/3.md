#### use $group to get the group of gender availabe in the whole test collection.It gives you a list how many gender availabe here

```javascript
db.test.aggregate([
  //stage-1
  { $group: { _id: "$gender" } },
]);
// this will give also how many female there and male there this types count results.
db.test.aggregate([
  //stage-1
  { $group: { _id: "$gender", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
]);

//another example
db.test.aggregate([
  //stage-1
  { $group: { _id: "$age", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
]);
```

#### this will give the documents with \_id as country name and property amkDekaoName with name value of the original test collection. so we get the info of how many name availabe in each country.

```javascript
db.test.aggregate([
  //stage-1
  { $group: { _id: "$address.country", amkDekhao: { $push: "$name" } } },
]);
// this will give counts of name
db.test.aggregate([
  //stage-1
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$address.country",
      count: { $sum: 1 },
      amkDekhao: { $push: "$name" },
    },
  },
]);

//this will give you just like name but here it gives you the whole documents in the amkDekao field instead of just giving the name by $$ROOT
db.test.aggregate([
  //stage-1
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$address.country",
      count: { $sum: 1 },
      fullDoc: { $push: "$$ROOT" },
    },
  },
]);

// this will give specif information from fullDoc
db.test.aggregate([
  //stage-1
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$address.country",
      count: { $sum: 1 },
      fullDoc: { $push: "$$ROOT" },
    },
  },
  //stage-2
  {
    $project: {
      count: 1,
      "fullDoc.name": 1,
      "fullDoc.email": 1,
      "fullDoc.phone": 1,
    },
  },
]);
```
